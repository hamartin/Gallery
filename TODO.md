GALLERY
=======

- Fix the layout and graphics. It can be done better.
- Add a button on the "max size" images right upper corner that flips the
  image and shows original image data. The flipped image contains this data and
  more.
  - Size in KiB/MiB.
  - Vertical and horisontal size.
  - When the picture was taken.
  - Type of image.
  - Who took the picture.
- Try to create a dynamic CSS by using
  - templates and urls.py.
  - a script that generates or modifies the CSS when executed.
  We do this so that we can define the look of the Gallery in
  Gallery-settings.py and be able to change its looks.
